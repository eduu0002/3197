        The world is still battling the climate crisis with 87% of the world's
        <span class="bad">greenhouse gases</span> being a product of our energy
        production proccesses. However, the solution is not just simply to
        reduce use of <span class="bad">fossil fuels</span>. Below we will look
        at another energy crisis that is not often talked about.

          In the last 10 years, both United States of America and China have
          been the largest
          <span class="green">producers of electricity</span> by a large margin
          as compared to the rest of the world with North America being one of
          the largest importers of energy and Europe the largest exporters of
          energy.

          The <span class="bad">energy consumption</span> per capita has
          decreased globally and we can see a steady increase in the production
          of cleaner fuels with countries like Canada and Brazil which has more
          than 80% of their electricity being produced from
          <span class="green">clean fuels</span>. Countries like China and USA
          who are the largest consumers of
          <span class="bad">fossil fuels</span> have also increased their
          <span class="green">renewable energy production by 50%</span> from
          2000 - 2020.

          Majority of the world has made some slow and steady strides to
          <span class="green">renewable and clean</span> energies however, there
          is another problem that needs to be addressed which can be seen on the
          left sides of these scatter plots. Countries with low GDP Per Capita
          less than 10,000 like Uganda and Ethiopia are struggling to have
          access to any energy at all. We can see from the first scatter plot
          renewable energy is a privilege only for wealthy countries. Poorer
          countries like Uganda and Ethiopia lack access to modern energy
          sources and, as a result, the majority of the population would have to
          rely on <span class="bad">solid fuel sources</span> like firewood. The
          use of firewood is predominantly used in homes which carries a high
          risk of respitory problems as combustion of firewood releases
          <span class="bad">methane and carbon monoxide</span> into the air.
          <p>
            While the world is struggling with global CO2 pollution, less
            developed countries are also struggling with indoor pollution due to
            energy poverty. Until these issues are addressed it seems unlikely
            that the world will be able to solve our current energy crisis
            anytime soon.
